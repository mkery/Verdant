 ISSUES MORE CDS TO CURB MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH

    TAIPEI, April 18 - The central bank has issued 5.3 billion
Taiwan dlrs of certificates of deposits (CDs), boosting CD
issues so far this year to 140.42 billion compared with 16
billion issued in the same 1986 period.
    The new CDs, with maturities of six months, one year and
two years, carry interest rates ranging from 4.07 to 5.12 pct,
a bank spokesman told Reuters.
    The issues are aimed at helping curb the growth of M-1b
money supply, the result of large foreign exchange reserves now
at more than 53 billion U.S. Dlrs.
