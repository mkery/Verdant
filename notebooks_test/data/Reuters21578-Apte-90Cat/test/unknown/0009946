    HONG KONG, April 9 - <Goodman Fielder Ltd>, an Australian
food products and supermarket firm, is planning a 100 mln U.S.

    Under the three-year "evergreen" facility, which can be
extended annually, notes will be issued by its subsidiaries

a non-underwritten basis, but the outstanding total is limited
to 100 mln U.S. Dlrs, BT Asia said.

one to three years, it added.
    The management fee was not disclosed and syndication is
