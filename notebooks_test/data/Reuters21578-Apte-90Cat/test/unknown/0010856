 UNIT SELLS PRIORITY SUBORDINATED NOTES

    NEW YORK, April 13 - National Gypsum Co, a unit of Aancor
Holdings Inc, said it is offering 300 mln dlrs of priority
senior subordinated notes due 1997 with an 11-3/8 pct coupon
and par pricing.
    Non-redeemable for five years, the issue is rated B-2 by
Moody's Investors Service Inc and B by Standard and Poor's

current revolving credit facility. Goldman, Sachs and Co and
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets underwrote the deal.
