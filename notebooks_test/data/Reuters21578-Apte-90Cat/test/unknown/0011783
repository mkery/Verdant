 BANK TO LOAN JAMAICA 104 MLN DLRS

    WASHINGTON, June 19 - The World Bank said it approved loans
to Jamaica totalling 104 mln dlrs to assist it with an economic
structural adjustment program, a sugar industry rehabilitation
scheme and a population and health project.
    The bank said two loans will support Jamaica's structural
adjustment program -- a 40 mln dlr loan for the trade and
financial sector and a 20 mln dlr loan for the public
enterprise sector.
    The bank said a 34 mln dlr loan is to help Jamaica's sugar
industry become self-sufficient and meet both domestic demand
and the export demand of the United States and European
Community.
    The fourth loan, for 10 mln dlrs, is to improve family
planning programs and health care.
