 SEEKS 600 MLN ECU LOAN FROM EC

    BELGRADE, March 25 - Yugoslavia is seeking a loan of 600
mln ECUs from the European Community for transport system
modernisation, Deputy Finance Minister Boris Skapin was quoted
by the official Tanjug news agency.
    The community has offered Yugoslavia only 380 mln ECUs, he
said. The loan is to help finance completion of Yugoslavia's
north-south motorway, railway modernisation and export-oriented
industrial projects.
    Skapin told reporters in Brussels yesterday the requested
loan accounted for only 10 pct of total funds needed for these
projects, Tanjug said.
