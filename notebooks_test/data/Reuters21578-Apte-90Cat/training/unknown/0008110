 FARM CREDIT BANKS DEFER APRIL 20 OFFERING

    NEW YORK, March 31 - The Farm Credit Funding Corp said it
will not issue bonds as scheduled on April 21 because of a
decline in borrower needs for term credit.
    A total of 1.461 billion dlrs of bonds maturing on April 20
will be retired with excess cash and internally generated
funds.
    The next term debt offering is scheduled for June 1, with
an announcement covering the terms due on May 21.
    The farm credit system's reduced need for medium- to
long-term financing also enabled it to cancel bond issues
scheduled for January 20 and last October 20.
