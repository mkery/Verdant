 LAUNCHES 100 MLN DLR BONDS

    HELSINKI, March 30 - Finland's <Kansallis-Osake-Pankki>
said in a statement it is issuing 100 mln dlrs subordinated
bonds due 1994 with equity warrants in international markets
with maximum interest rate of 4-5/8 pct.
    Pricing will probably be April 7, the statement said.
    The new issue could raise the bank's share capital by 200
mln Finnish marks from the present 2.26 billion, it said.
    The statement said the issue followed up the 1986 tender
issuance involving the first non-restricted or free shares,
which can be held by aliens.
    The warrants entitle holders to subscribe for a maximum of
10 mln free shares. Eight mln of the Bank's current 113 mln
shares are free shares, a spokeswoman said.
    The float follows the signing by Finnish President Mauno
Koivisto last Friday of legislation entitling aliens with
effect from next June 1 to own up to two fifths of the shares
in Finnish companies, with consent of the Council of State, as
against one fifth although voting rights will be restricted.
