 GAS <PCG> PLANT TO BEGIN REFUELING

    SAN FRANCISCO, April 3 - Pacific Gas and Electric Co said
its Diablo Canyon Unit 2 nuclear power plant will begin its
first refueling today after about 13 months of operation.
    The refueling outage is expected to last about 12 weeks and
will include a variety of maintenance as well as the
replacement of about one-third of Unit 2's fuel, the company
said.
    Pacific Gas said Unit 2 generated power about 93.7 pct of
the time during its first year of operation.
    Pacific Gas' two Diablo Canyon units generate about 2.2 mln
kilowatts of electricity in full operation.
