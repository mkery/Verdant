 LIKELY TO GET OVER 100 MLN DLRS IN AID

    PARIS, March 9 - Morocco, buoyed by an economic turnaround
and last week's Paris Club debt rescheduling, is likely to
obtain over 100 mln dlrs worth of development aid at a meeting
with donors beginning here tomorrow, John Shilling, director of
the World Bank's Moroccan division, said.
    "A certain optimism has appeared in the economy to the
effect that things are no longer impossible and Morocco can get
out of its problems ... We are aiming for 100 mln Special
Drawing Rights and if we can get more it will be put to good
use," he told a news conference.
    The agreement last week with the Paris Club of western
creditors rescheduling over 10 years 900 mln dlrs worth of
official debt due by mid-1988, together with an accord late
last year to reschedule 1.8 billion dlrs of commercial bank
debt, had already encouraged donors to increase aid, he added.
    Debt sources said a World Bank concessional loan of around
200 mln dlrs to help rationalise Morocco's public sector was
likely to be agreed in Washington soon.
