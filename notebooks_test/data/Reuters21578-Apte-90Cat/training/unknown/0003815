 AG> UNIT TO RAISE 500 MLN DLRS

    NEW YORK, March 16 - <Hoechst AG's> Hoechst Celanese Corp
subsidiary said it plans to raise about 500 mln dlrs in U.S.
capital markets in three to four months.
    Company officials, at a press conference, said the money
would be raised through the sale of debentures, adding these
securities are expected to be registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission following Standard and Poor's Corp's
rating of the company's debt next week.
    Officials said most of the funds raised will be used to pay
down 600 mln dlrs of bridge loans taken out last month when
American Hoechst bought Celanese for 2.8 billion dlrs.
    The officals said Hoechst Celenese's 1987 capital spending
of over 200 mln dlrs will be funded from internally generated
cash. They pointed out this is little changed from the combined
spending of American Hoechst and Celanese Corp in 1986.
