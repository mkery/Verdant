 UPGRADES GE <GE> MORTGAGE INSURANCE UNIT

    NEW YORK, March 4 - Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
upgraded to Aaa from Aa-1 the insurance rating of General
Electric Mortgage Insurance Co of Ohio, a unit of General
Electric Co.
    Moody's said this reflected the strengthening of terms in a
revised net worth agreement between GEMICO and its immediate
parent, General Electric Credit Corp, whose long-term unsecured
debt is also a top-flight Aaa.
    However, the rating agency said the agreement does not
benefit other GEMICO affiliates in California, Florida and
North Carolina.
