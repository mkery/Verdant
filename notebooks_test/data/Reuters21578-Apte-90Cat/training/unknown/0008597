 <MRN> GETS ARMY CONTRACT

    BOISE, Idaho, April 1 - Morrison-Knudsen Corp said Black
River Constructors, a joint venture with Martin Eby and a
subsidiary of Hunt Corp, has received a 517-mln-dlr
construction contract from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers.
    The work includes the construction of more than 70
buildings and associated infrastructure to accommodate the
Army's new 10th Mountain Division.
    In a press release, Rep. David O'B. Martin, N.Y., said the
awarding of the contract is subject to Congressional review.
Morrison-Knudsen said the contract represents the largest Army
construction in this country since World War II.
    Congress has authorized and appropriated 610 mln dlrs for
the project, the company said.
    If everything continues on schedule, work on the Ft. Drum,
N.Y. site is expected to begin later this month and is
scheduled for completion by early 1991, the company said.
    Martin said that an additional 50 mln dlrs in contracts to
small and disadvantaged businesses will be announced later.
