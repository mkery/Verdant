 FINANCIAL <RLRF> WON'T BE DELISTED

    LAUDERHILL, Fla., March 11 - RLR Financial Services Inc
said the National Association of Securities Dealers has decided
not to delist its stock from NASDAQ on March 12 as it had
threatened.
    The company said the NASD has granted it an indeterminate
amount of time to resolve issues raised by the NASD on the
market making of RLR's RLR Securities Group Inc subsidiary in
shares of the parent company.
    The NASD had alleged that no registration statement for the
shares was in effect.  RLR contested the charge but stopped
market making in its own stock.
