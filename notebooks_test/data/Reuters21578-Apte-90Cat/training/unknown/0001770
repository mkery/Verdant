 ISSUING CONVERTIBLE EUROBOND

    PARIS, March 6 - Moet-Hennessy <MHSP.PA> is issuing an 800
mln French franc 10-year eurobond with share warrants,
lead-manager Lazard Freres et Cie said.
    The issue will be priced at par with a one pct coupon, and
each 10,000 franc bond will carry 18 warrants, each giving the
right to subscribe to Moet-Hennessy shares over a three-year
period at 2,720 francs each. The high equity content of the
issue accounts for the low coupon.
    Moet-Hennessy shares closed on the Paris Bourse today at
2,678 francs, up 38 from yesterday's close.
    The issue is being co-lead managed by Credit Lyonnais,
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Credit Suisse First Boston.
    Payment date will be April 8.
