 B. HALL <FBH> OFFERS NEW SERVICE

    CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 11 - Frank B. Hall and Co, an
insurance and brokerage firm, said it has joined with <Risk
Science International> to offer banks a new service that
assesses their environmental risk level.
    Hall said that under recently enacted legislation banks and
other financial institutions can be held liable for
environmental risks in projects that they finance.
    Therefore, Hall said, RSI will evaluate a property, assign
it an environmental risk level and advise the bank about its
options to reduce environmental risks.
