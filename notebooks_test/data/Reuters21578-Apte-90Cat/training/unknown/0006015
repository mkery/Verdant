 GERMANY SHARPLY BOOSTS AID TO BOLIVIA

    LA PAZ, March 24 - West German aid to Bolivia will rise to
91 mln marks in 1987 from 50 mln in 1986, West German President
Richard Von Weizsaecker said.
    Weizsaecker, speaking to the Bolivian Congress yesterday,
said of Latin America's 380 billion dlr foreign debt, "Debtor
countries and creditors must cooperate with the banks and
international financial organizations to find long-term
solutions." Bolivia's debts total 4.4 billion dlrs.
    "We wish to reach a reasonable agreement with Bolivia so
that the country can experience a significant financial
respite," Weizsaecker said.
    The two countries earlier signed two technical and
financial cooperation treaties. West German officials said aid
last year included 35 mln marks in financial cooperation.
    Bolivian Foreign Minister Guillermo Bedregal told reporters
West Germany would provide 300 mln marks to help fight
Bolivia's cocaine trade.
    The illegal trade in cocaine is West Germany's most
worrisome drug problem, West German officials said.
