 - MELLON <MEL> UNIT'S NOTES

    NEW YORK, March 6 - First Boston Corp said it is selling
150 mln dlrs of deposit notes due 1992 that it bought from
Mellon Bank NA, a unit of Mellon Bank Corp.
    First Boston is offering the notes to the public with a
7.45 pct coupon and par pricing. That is 73 basis points more
than the yield of comparable Treasury securities.
    The issue has a one-time call after three years, First
Boston detailed. If the notes are not redeemed at that time,
they will be non-callable to maturity.
    -- First Boston corrects that it, not Mellon, is selling
the notes to the public.
