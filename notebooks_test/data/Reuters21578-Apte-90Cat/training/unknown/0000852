 TREASURY OFFICIAL SEES LATIN DEBT PROGRESS

    WASHINGTON, March 3 - Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary
David Mulford said rapid progress was being made in talks with
commercial banks for loans to Argentina, the Philippines and
Brazil.
    "This should result in substantial new lending for the
major debtors in 1987," he said in prepared testimony for the
Subcommittee on International Development Institutions of the
U.S. House of Representatives.
    Until recently, commercial banks were slow to conclude new
financing packages pending completion of a Mexican package,
Mulford said.
