pricing. This tranche is non-callable to maturity.
    A 125 mln dlr issue of second priority secured equipment
certificates due 1995 has an 11 pct coupon and par pricing and
an equal-sized offering of third priority certificates due 1999
was given an 11-3/8 pct coupon and par pricing.
    The second two tranches of the equipment-backed deal are
non-callable for five years, Drexel said.
    Continental's 10-year notes were assigned an 11-1/2 pct
coupon and priced at par. They are non-callable for five years.
Texas Air has guaranteed the scheduled payments of interest and
principal for the senior notes.
    The securities are rated B-2 by Moody's and B by Standard
and Poor's. Kidder Peabody, Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney
co-managed the issues. Proceeds, estimated at 486 mln dlrs,
will be used to repay about 254 mln dlrs of bank debt, with the
remainder added to working capital, Continental said.
