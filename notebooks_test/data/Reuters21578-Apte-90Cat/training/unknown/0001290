37,950,000 shares.
    The company explained that underwriters exercised in full
their option to increase tohe offering by buying an additional
4,950,000 shares over and above the 33 mln brought to market
yesterday. Originally, Occidental had planned to offer 30 mln
shares. It had 165 mln outstanding prior to the offering.
    The underwriters are Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Kidder

from applying the net proceeds of the offering, principally to
