 MARCH BOND COUPON SEEN UNCHANGED AT FIVE PCT

     TOKYO, Feb 27 - The Finance Ministry has proposed
informally to its bond underwriting syndicate that the coupon
on the January 10-year government bond remain unchanged from
February at five pct, underwriting sources said.
    They said the ministry wants a 0.50 yen raise in issue
price from February to 99.50 to yield a record low 5.075 pct.
    The 5.151 pct February bond issue yield was itself a record
low. The proposed issue volume is 475 billion yen against the
600 billion in February.
    The underwriting syndicate is likely to accept the proposed
terms immediately, the sources said.
