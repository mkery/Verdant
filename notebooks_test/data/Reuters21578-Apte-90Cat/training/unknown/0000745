 <LOR> DEBT LOWERED BY S/P

    NEW YORK, March 3 - Standard and Poor's Corp said it
lowered the ratings on Loral Corp's subordinated debt to BBB
from A-minus.
    The issue is removed from creditwatch where it was placed
with negative implications in January after Loral said it
planned to acquire Goodyear Aerospace Corp for 640 mln dlrs.
    S/P said the acquisition enhances Loral's competitive
position in the defense electronics industry by broadening its
technology and program base. But most measures of financial
risk deteriorate, it said.
