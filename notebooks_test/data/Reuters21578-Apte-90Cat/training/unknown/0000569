 BANKS ASKED TO TAKE PART IN INDONESIA LOAN

    TAIPEI, Mar 3 - Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd of Hong Kong has
approached Taiwan banks to take part in a syndicated loan of
300 mln U.S. Dlrs to finance a liquefied natural gas (LNG)
project in Indonesia, local banking sources said.
    The project calls for construction of a 400 mln U.S. Dlr
facility which could produce two mln tonnes of LNG for supply
by Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp .
    This was the first time Taiwanese banks, including the Bank
of Taiwan and Bank of Communications, were invited to form a
syndicated loan, they added.
    Pertamina has initialled a 20-year contract with Chinese
Petroleum Corp <CPC> for the supply of 1.5 mln tonnes of LNG
for Taiwan starting October 1989, a CPC official said.
    CPC is building an LNG receiving terminal in southern
Taiwan city of Kaohsiung at a cost of 820 mln U.S. Dlrs. The
terminal will be completed in mid-1989.
    A Taiwanese banker said"It will be a good idea for our banks
to take part in the loan if we want to start in the
international lending market."
