 MOTOR CREDIT <F> TO REDEEM DEBENTURES

    DEARBORN, MICH., Feb 26 - Ford Motor Co said its Ford Motor
Credit Co on April One will redeem 4.0 mln dlrs of its 8.70 pct
debentures due April 1, 1999.
    It said the debentures are redeemable at a price of 100 pct
of the principal. Because April 1, 1987 is an interest payment
date on the debentures, no accrued interest will be payable on
the redemption date as part of the redemption proceeds.
    Debentures will be selected for redemption on a pro rata
basis, Ford said.
