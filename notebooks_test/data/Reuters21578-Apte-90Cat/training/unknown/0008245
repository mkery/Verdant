 BRAZILIAN PARTY SUPPORTS MORATORIUM

    BRASILIA, MARCH 31 - Brazil's leading political party has
expressed full support to President Jose Sarney's decision
suspending interest payment of 68 billion dollars owed to
private foreign banks.
    Besides expressing its support, the government's Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) urged Sarney to keep on with
his decision "up to the last consequences."
    Conducted by veteran party leader Ulysses Guimaraes, head
of Brazil's Constituent Assembly, the PMDB praised Finance
Minister Dilson Funaro for his courage to propose suspension of
interest payment of the debt for an indefinite period.
    The Brazilian government announced suspension of interest
payment on part of its 109-billion dlrs foreign debt on
February 20.
    "The road to dignity has no return," said a document issued
by the PMDB.
    The party said the government's decision also had the
support of all sectors of society, including the governors of
22 Brazilian states.
    The statement said Brazil had two ways to take: "A return,
by way of submission to manoeuvres and outside pressure... Or
the way which leads the country to its independence."
