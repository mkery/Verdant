 MAY DOWNGRADE CLARK EQUIPMENT <CKL>

    NEW YORK, March 11 - Standard and Poor's said it may lower
its BBB-minus rating of Clark Equipment Co's 108 mln dlrs of
long-term debt because of weak industry fundamentals and the
company's plan to repurchase 70 mln dlrs worth of common stock.
    Despite a dramatic rationalization of its fork-lift truck,
axle and transmission, and construction equipment operations,
continuing intense competitive pressures are limiting Clark's
growth and profit potential, S and P said.
    The company may be forced to increase debt to achieve its
strategic acquisition goals, the rating agency added.
