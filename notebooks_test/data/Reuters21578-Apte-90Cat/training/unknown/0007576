 MARK EUROBOND ISSUE NOW UNCERTAIN

    FRANKFURT, March 30 - Plans by the U.S.-based ICN
Pharmaceuticals Inc <ICN.N> to issue a mark eurobond soon are
in doubt owing to uncertainties about future expansion, Arab
Banking Corp - Daus and Co GmbH (ABC DAUS) said.
    During a presentation in February ICN had said it would
issue its first mark eurobond sometime this spring
    ICN planned to issue a bond to provide funds to acquire
pharmaceuticals firms and expand its marketing base, Daus said
in a statement. But uncertainty about an acquisition, coupled
with Eastman Kodak Co's <EK.N> announcement it plans to sell
its 2.3 pct stake in ICN, had made a launch date uncertain.
