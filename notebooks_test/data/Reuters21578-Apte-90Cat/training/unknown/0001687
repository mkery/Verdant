    NEW YORK, March 6 - USG Corp is raising 100 mln dlrs
through an offering of notes due 1997 with an eight pct coupon

Treasury paper. Non-callable to maturity, the notes are rated
A-1 by Moody's and A by Standard and Poor's. Goldman Sachs and
Shearson Lehman Brothers co-managed the deal.

due 2017 that were priced to yield 8.77 pct, or 120 basis
points over Treasuries, through a syndicate headed by Salomon
Brothers.
