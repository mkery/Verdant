 TO OFFER CHOICE OF INVESTMENTS

    PARIS, March 5 - Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French channel
tunnel consortium, will offer potential backers a wide choice
of ways to invest in a planned 750 mln stg capital issue later
this year, co-Chairman Alastair Morton said.
    Speaking to reporters after a shareholders meeting, he said
Eurotunnel would offer "a menu of securities" designed to
overcome investor reluctance.
    Details are still to be worked out but investors could be
offered a choice of paying immediately for shares or buying
them on a part-paid basis, or buying convertible bonds, or
bonds with warrants giving a right to buy shares at a later
date, he said.
