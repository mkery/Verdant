    LONDON, March 27 - The cocoa buffer stock rules just
decided by the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council
will take effect immediately, delegates said.
    That means the buffer stock manager is likely to begin
buying cocoa within two or three weeks, after organizing
communication systems and assessing the market, they said.
