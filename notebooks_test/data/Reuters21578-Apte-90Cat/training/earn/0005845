    DAYTON, Ohio, March 23 - Moto Photo Inc  president, Michael
Adler, said he expects the company's first quarter earnings for
fiscal 1987 to be better than the same quarter a year ago.
    Adler said, however, that the quarter would still be a
loss, primarily because it is the low season for the imaging
business.

ending March 31 of 328,889 dlrs.
