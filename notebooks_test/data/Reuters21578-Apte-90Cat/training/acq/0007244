    TOKYO, March 27 - Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.TOK> said it has
taken a 25 pct stake worth five mln krone in <Danish Dairy
Farms Ltd> and will jointly market its produce from April.
    The company was set up last year by three major Danish
livestock cooperative federations to expand markets for their
dairy products, a Mitsubishi official said.
    This is the first time a Japanese trading house has traded
non-Japanese dairy products in the world market, he said.
    He said Mitsubishi expects the Danish company's annual
sales to be 10 billion yen in its first year, from April 1.
