    GREENWICH, Conn., March 25 - Clabir Corp and AmBrit Corp
said they called off their plans for Clabir to buy the 16 pct
voting interest in AmBrit that it does not already own.
    The companies said they agreed not to pursue the merger
because several actions recently taken by AmBrit would mean
substantial delays in completing the deal.
    They said they might revive merger plans at a later date or
seek other ways for Clabir to increase its holdings in AmBrit.
