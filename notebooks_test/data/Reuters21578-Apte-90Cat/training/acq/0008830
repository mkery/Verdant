    FRANKFURT, April 2 - Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> has agreed
to take over the outstanding 25 pct in <Deutsche Bank (Asia)
AG>, the former <European Asian Bank AG>, from
Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI>, Deutsche management board
joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference.
    Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from
Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with
Creditanstalt.
    Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of
Lloyds Bank plc <LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said.
    Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent
capital increase of <Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no
plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell.
    <Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was
acquired from Bankamerica Corp <BAC.N> late last year, would be
consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of
Deutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F.
Wilhelm Christians said.
    Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High
Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the
balance sheet section "participations," Christians said.
    But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these
non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active
participation.
    Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks
in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise
to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.
    Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance
sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in
a separate holding company.
